LOT Polish Airlines,9,"""consider using this airline again""",17th April 2025,True,"Split to London Heathrow via Warsaw on 16th April 2025. Firstly, at Split airport, one has to check-in at the counter rather than online. This was absolutely fine and I was dealt with in a most professional and friendly manner by a member of the Split Airport staff, the young lady in question was both professional and friendly and a created a great impression of her company. Boarding was efficiently managed at Split airport and the aircraft used for the flight to Warsaw Chopin airport was an Embraer 190. The cabin-crew took security very seriously and made sure passengers complied. I saw cabin crew proactively checking the areas under seats and making sure baggage was stored away correctly. Transfer at Warsaw airport was efficient, LOT staff were on-hand to help passengers and alas my onward flight was delayed. However, they kept passengers well informed with text messages and announcements. The flight to London was on an immaculate Boeing 737max, the staff were exceptionally professional. A snack and coffee was offered. It is a shame there was no route map. I will certainly consider using this airline again should the opportunity arise.",Embraer 190 and Boeing 737 Max,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to London,April 2025,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes
LOT Polish Airlines,8,"""I am impressed""",17th April 2025,True,"London Heathrow to Split via Warsaw and I am impressed. The website was user-friendly and online check-in worked well and the airline kept me updated with text messages. I found this efficient and practical. My one gripe was a very rude woman on the check-in / bag drop. The flight check-in / bag drop off was very early in the morning. The woman in question was very abrupt towards an elderly couple ahead of me in the queue. When it came to my turn the uniformed staff member raised her voice in an unseemly manner and shouted at me to remove my printed boarding pass from the A4 plastic sleeve I had placed it in. I made it clear that her manner was not acceptable. The agent continued a private conversation with one of her colleagues and literally clicked her fingers at another customer. The woman could not communicate in a civil manner. Setting the above aside, departure from London was prompt on a clean Boeing 737-Max. Although there was no inflight entertainment, the staff worked hard, were polite, professional and multi-lingual. They served complimentary tea / coffee and a snack consisting of a bun as well as the option to purchase other items. Disembarkation and transfer at Warsaw Airport was efficient. My second flight to Split was on an Embraer 190, again the staff were superb. The flight to Split was punctual and the captain bid farewell to the passengers as they disembarked. That was a nice touch.",Boeing 737 Max,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Warsaw,April 2025,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes
LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""return flight was a nightmare""",7th March 2025,True,"I was quite impressed by the flight from Istanbul to Krakow, I found the plane comfortable with an adequate service and I couldn’t imagine that my return flight was a nightmare and probably the worst in my life. We arrived at Krakow airport and we found that our flight to Istanbul was just “cancelled” no information was provided- We went to LOT customer service that informed us that our flight departure was changed to Warsaw and that a bus was waiting for us to take us to the Chopina airport in 3 hours. The trip lasted almost 5 hrs and no information was provided. We headed to the check-in and we learned that they couldn’t find the luggage and the meal we ordered and paid for online so we were sent to the ticket office at 8:00 and our flight was supposed to depart around 8:30. The ticket office also informed us that there was no luggage and meal included and we had to pay for that. It took a while to convince the ticket office that we paid and there was no need to be double charged and then finally they found it. No information was given to us about the departure time and we started rushing to catch the flight. During our marathon to the gate, we learned that boarding was delayed. We got onboard and we were informed that on the flight, we were not allowed the pork sandwiches we ordered, that the electric sockets behind the seats were not working. I am surprised to see the poor management of this common situation due to bad weather in Krakow. I think it’s not unusual to find such a situation and that the airline should be already prepared for this. During this 7 hours not even a glass of water was provided to us . Today we received an email that the airline cannot refund the meals that I paid for and were not served during the flight",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Krakow to istanbul,December 2024,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1,no
LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""beyond disappointing""",5th March 2025,True,"Our recent experience flying with LOT Airlines from Vilnius to Miami via Warsaw was beyond disappointing. What was supposed to be a smooth and well-planned journey turned into a frustrating and stressful ordeal due to the mismanagement and complete lack of customer care. We booked three seats, two for my husband, one for myself, an additional seat was added to ensure a comfortable journey for us and our pet. Everything seemed fine during online check-in for the first leg of our flight. However, at the airport, LOT’s staff only issued us two boarding passes and assured us that the third seat was reserved. When we boarded the plane in Warsaw, we were shocked to find that the seat we had paid for was given to another passenger. LOT’s mistake not only caused us significant discomfort but also resulted in our booking being falsely marked as a ""no-show."" The most frustrating part wasn’t just the mistake, it was how LOT handled it. Despite having clear proof of payment and check-in, we received no meaningful support or apology. To make matters worse, the cabin crew, while technically following procedures, lacked the most basic empathy or communication skills. No one acknowledged our distress, offered any kind of solution, or even apologized. Imagine being on a long-haul flight, having paid extra for comfort, and being completely ignored when that service was not provided. LOT Airlines may offer pet-friendly travel, but our experience proves that when things go wrong, they do not take responsibility. If you have an option to fly with another airline, take it—you’ll save yourself a lot of stress and disappointment.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to Miami,January 2025,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1,no
LOT Polish Airlines,1,“do not care about customer satisfaction”,11th February 2025,True,"I had a terrible experience with LOT Polish Airlines regarding my refund. I paid extra for a cancellation flexibility fee, which was supposed to allow me to cancel my flight and receive a refund. However, after canceling, LOT only refunded the taxes and completely ignored the extra fee I paid for flexibility. Despite multiple attempts to contact customer service and providing all necessary documents, they refused to return the money they owe me. Their responses were vague, unhelpful, and avoided addressing the issue directly. It feels like they are just keeping my money unfairly. I expected better from a major airline, but this experience has shown me they do not care about customer satisfaction. If you're considering flying with LOT, be very careful with their refund policies—you might end up losing your money like I did. I will not be flying with them again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Israel to Canada,January 2025,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no
LOT Polish Airlines,4,"""110€ to check in another bag""",7th January 2025,False,"We flew to Delhi and only on the way back they asked us to weigh our backpacks. Apparently backpacks can only weigh 2 kg. Not only is this weight rather unreasonable, the policy of weighing backpacks is completely ridiculous. It allowed them to have us pay an additional 110€ to check in another bag. They should have at least allowed people on a return ticket to fly back the same way they came. But it’s obviously a great way to make extra money which is earning them customers who will not take more flights with them. Additionally the food is abysmal, they don’t let you choose veg or non-veg and they served us a full-on dinner at 9:30 in the morning. The second meal was a tiny hot pocket. The toilets also became incredibly disgusting after a few hours with paper running out etc.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Amsterdam via Warsaw,January 2025,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2,no
LOT Polish Airlines,1,“The seats were horrible”,3rd January 2025,False,"I am so disappointed in the LOT Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft after this flight I just had. This was probably the most uncomfortable international flight I have ever experienced with the most uncomfortable economy seats I have ever purchased. I usually never upgrade to premium economy because so far had great experiences with basic economy with other airlines, until now. The seats were horrible. The space between the arm rest and window is merely a couple centimetres. The seats have no cushioning they are very hard, not easily reclinable. It was brutal for a 9 hour flight and I've flown 12 hours to Dubai previously in economy with amazing comfort. I always take a window seat due to my anxiety and the freedom to look out the window. I did not like the feature of the windows dimming and sealing on their own. Part of being in the window seat is to have control over the window shades for some people with anxiety to ease their comfort, and control the window shade. At some point I felt very nervous because we have no control, the cabin controls the windows on their own. Pitch black could not even see the blinking lights on the wing to ease my mind. Absolutely no wifi or no wifi feature, how suffocating it is to not have wifi and/or option to peek outside the window? How is this flying in 2024? My TV monitor was broken completely. The calibration on the monitor was not working correctly, so it was not allowing me to use the touch screen and I could not enjoy any movies entertainment or even the interactive map! Seemed so outdated and I'm disappointed I spent so much money on this flight. I would've paid almost half for other European airlines. I haven't flown with LOT in over 10 years, usually Lufthansa and I have it another chance. I frequently visit family in Poland every year, this was disappointing with Polish airlines being more expensive than Lufthansa and the experiences I had. Small detail coffee was cold and watery, fighting with bathroom doors to open correctly, but my main focus is the big details I mentioned above, this was not a comfortable flight.

LOT Polish Airlines,6,“seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw”,16th September 2024,True,"TOKYO/NRT to WAW with LO80 on 17 AUG and back with LO79 on 29 AUG, in Business Class for both legs. I took the LOT flight for the first time in 4 and a half years. Before boarding, I knew LOT’s long-haul business class seat remains unchanged from my previous flight. That was why I thought I could get a tight sleep on a fully lie-flat bed despite no privacy around it. Something strange happened, however. The story is as follows. LO80 departs from NRT at 22:50. After taking off, I reclined my seat to the lie-flat position and fell asleep. In a couple of hours, I woke up. Surprisingly, I found my cell phone missing. I searched for it for 15 minutes but in vain. A neighbor advised me to ask for some help from a flight attendant and I followed her advice. In the meantime he came. He adjusted back my seat to the original position and took off the seat cushion deftly. I felt relieved that he had salvaged it from deep inside. It fell through a gap produced while I was reclining it. I aver this kind of happening is not rare because my neighboring passenger on the returning flight suffered from the same situation. Needless to say, I suggested that he ask for a flight attendant. I learned that those seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw, that is, almost no storage room. As far as an in-flight meal goes, I propose that Japanese meal be avoided. I also remember that a female attendant looked a little puzzled when I requested an individual dinner the trouble mentioned above. They may not be accustomed to taking individual care of business class passengers. No Wi-Fi service is available, on the other hand, the in-flight entertainment is limited. That said, LOT is still attractive in that they have the extensive network in Central and Eastern Europe whose hub is Warsaw Chopin Airport and the round-trip business class fare presented by LOT between Japan and Europe is two-thirds of ones by JAL and ANA.",Boeing 789,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to Warsaw,August 2024,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,4,yes

Then later on I decided to add an extra checked in luggage online for the return flight but their website did not work, and I could not do that. I started a WhatsApp chat with their Customer service at 15:46 yesterday, and they answered at 9:57 am the next day.

I also had a run in with one flight attendant that wouldn't allow my carry on in the over head compartment and wanted it on my lap for a 10 hour flight. No reason, she just wanted it her way. Luckily another passenger stepped in and took my side. For the rest of the flight she was giving me dirty looks. Extremely unprofessional. On my most recent flight after check in and security, and everything cleared, I was also stopped by a LOT check in clerk that wouldn't allow me to bring folding fishing poles on board.

So, I pay online for the second one. My CC payment was accepted. Then when I arrived at the airport, a surprise. I was told that online payment is for 1pcs baggage but is valid for return Flight? And to check-in my second baggage I must pay almost double, 140.00 USD in cash only! Credit Card terminal is not working! Imagine this, major international airport and LOT is unable to accept Credit Cards payments?! What a Shame. Next, I ask to apply amount I already paid towards second baggage payment, since I never intended to carry any baggage on return Flight. Nope, this cannot be done. OK, I shelled out $140 cash and asked to refund my payment to CC. Nope this cannot be done either. I can only get a voucher for a similar service on the same route and must use it within 2 years. Thanks, but no thanks. I want my money back. The LOT representative was no help, supervisor was unavailable. I disputed this charge with CC. And guess what? LOT claim, that I have check-in baggage on return flight! No refund. Fortunately, I found a return flight Boarding Pass. And it is back on white - 0 Pices of baggage - 0Kg. What a LOT of robbers.

LOT Polish Airlines,9,“a great flight with LOT”,28th June 2024,True,"This was not my first time flying with LOT, and any previous flights with them has been quite good. This one was no exception, I therefore wanted to write this review. To give them a little credit. Firstly, the booking site has gone through some upgrades since last time, something that I was very happy to see. The ticket price was also not that bad (for a legacy airline), and cheaper than KLM or Lufthansa I could have flown on this route. As far as I am concerned you can find affordable prices on LOT even a few days prior to departure. The price you pay and the value you get on board LOT is also comparable, and in my opinion much better than other large European legacy carriers. For example: - I was offered to check in my carry-on baggage free of charge at the check-in counter, something that was a pleasant surprise - You actually get a decent onboard complimentary service, even on the domestic part of the journey, with several drinks for you to choose, and a savoury or sweet bun. - Comfortable and spacious seat with power outlets and a decent recline but I have to admit that there were things that could be better: - We had a bus-boarding in both Wroclaw and in Warsaw. That is of course nothing special, especially in the rush-hours at polish airports. However, all the passengers from an Embraer was squished into a small bus, something that wasn’t exactly comfortable in 30*C. I would have expected that on Ryanair or Wizzair, but I have to admit that I was a little surprised that this was a normal procedure at LOT too. And of course, I can’t wait for LOT to get their new planes, as they really could need a little upgrade to make the overall experience even better.

LOT Polish Airlines,2,"""not recommend to travel with LOT""",6th May 2024,True,"LO190 morning flight Tashkent to Warsaw on May 6th 2024. Economy class. No online check-in available ( local regulation). Boarding extremely slow and badly organised by airport staff. We spent 40 minutes in a bus (no AC, outside temperature 28 C) waiting. Finally we reached the plane - Boeing 737 Max. The temperature inside the plane was also very high. After another 25 minutes spent in a plane - still no air condition - some passengers started to complain on shortness of breath. Cabin crew offered them water. Departure was delayed approximately 20 minutes. Aircraft in a very basic version, typical for low cost carriers. No entertainment system, no WiFi. Uncomfortable narrow seats, very small, dirty, sticky table. After take off a modest breakfast was served on a tray. Beef goulash or chicken cutlet - quite strange choice for breakfast? The meal was followed by tea, coffee, drinks, red and white wine (cheap house option). Other alcoholic beverages were available for sale. There was one toilet in front of the plane for 6 premium class passengers and two toilets in the back for 180 economy passengers. The flight was 6 hours 20 minutes. Can you imagine this queue to economy toilets?  Ladies from cabin crew were focused on safety belts and their make up mainly, incidentally were really rude to some customers. Before landing in Warsaw a mystery pie and drinks were offered. The pie was covered with foil with no description. Arrival at destination airport was 25 minutes delayed. In summary, I would not recommend to travel with LOT on this route unless you want to spend more than 6 hours in a queue to toilet, without any entertainment system, having bad food served by unpleasant staff.",Boeing 737 max,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tashkent to Warsaw,May 2024,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no

LOT Polish Airlines,9,"""cabin service was excellent""",24th April 2024,True,"London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita via Warsaw Chopin return - 737-8 MAX London-Warsaw-London, 787-9 Dreamliner Warsaw-Tokyo-Warsaw. Family trip for wedding for three people (but not my wife)* - very cheap in my view at about £900 return each considering about half is tax. At this price you do have to pay extra for checked bags (we bought one). There is little wait at Warsaw both ways, which is one reason I booked this route, and also the starting flights are in the evening so no silly early starts. Outbound they waved us through a doorway at Warsaw Chopin to go directly to the long-haul gate and looking at flight times it seems they hold the flight if the incoming connection is late. Chopin is a modern airport that seems a less stressful place to change planes. You are asked to pay for assigned seats but I didn't waste money on this and on three flights we were given seats together anyway even though flights pretty full. On the other flight we were next to each other behind or across an aisle. Flights mostly smooth, planes clean and modern, and cabin service was excellent with skilled and patient aircrew. But the food is Polish-oriented and rather stodgy in economy but plentiful, and if you're coming back from Tokyo - home of superb food - this is a bit of an expected let down. If you like alternative/European movies there are Polish and some other arthouse productions well worth watching. The return from Narita-Warsaw routed via near the North Pole and was more than 1 hour ahead of schedule. Legroom on the Boeing 787 is rather cramped in economy and two of us are over 6 feet. Check in at Narita is tedious and be aware that if you need to buy another checked bag as we did LOT's online system didn't let us, and chatting online they only told us at the last minute we could pay for it at Narita (about £60 but ensure they bill it to one of the passengers without a checked bag otherwise you get overcharged as they did with us first). *I know you are wondering about wife - she went business class on China Airlines so we made use of her huge bag allowance!",Boeing 737/B787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Tokyo via Warsaw,April 2024,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5,yes

Seriously, nothing normal for a 4-hr flight? I remember taking Malév from Budapest to Krakow, maybe 20-25 minutes, with a lot better service. And zero in flight entertainment, of course. Anyway, what was even worse, the attitude of the flight attendants, the way the checked on the belt (that was in fact fastened), the way they suspected, I was not in airplane mode or the tone they told me they don't have blankets on this flight, which another flight attendant was later on handing out on the same class, so of course, I asked her afterwards.

The lack of communication and transparency is nothing short of appalling. It is disheartening to see a company that seemingly prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction. The stress and inconvenience caused by the mishandling of our baggage during what should have been a straightforward journey is unacceptable. In addition to the emotional distress, the financial burden incurred is something I did not anticipate when choosing this airline. They have the worst customer service ever. That was our worst business class experience. They mishandled our luggage and they did not even want to be held responsible. I strongly advise potential passengers to think twice before choosing this airline, as the risk of losing your belongings and enduring a lackluster response from the airline's customer service is not worth the potential savings in ticket prices.

We were flying in two groups, leaving on different dates and coming back on the same flight. The LOT reservation system is made that way that if you try to check prices for the same flight two or three times in the row on one login the prices are going up and up. For every check. Now we decided on flight and selected the flight. during the check out procedure (we even gotten the temp reservation number) lets say tickers were 860.00USD each way. During the checkout screen refreshed itself and we got bumped to the selection again. Guess what, the prices were 860.00 one way and 1400.00 return. The rest of the group were doing the reservation for the same flight with out issue. One person forgot to select the seats and meals and during the checkout got ""kicked out"" and when she returned back the prices were 1400 USD one way. So if your take your time to think, LOT kicks you out, or kicks you out if you check the same date and the same flight multiple time from the same computer. Its called ""cookies"". They track you and adjust the price while you are there. Premium seats with leg room come at a price of 70USD, 20USD and 16USD, depends on how much leg room you are willing to pay for. I flew with LOT 3 times in the row and each time with multiple members of my family. Each time premium economy. But after what they did to me today with price switching right from under my nose. I don't think I will use LOT again. Last thing, on the flight from JFK to WAW cabin crew instructed us to use the bathrooms on the end of the plane. With long lines. On the way back they let us use the lavatory in the galley between business and premium class. It seams that they do what ever they want or who they like.

The airport staff and flight attendants are rude and refuse to answer any simple question or give any directions in English. They seem to be constantly angry and frustrated. So very strange for an international company! And don't even think that if you call Customer Service anything will be done to help you or give you a decent alternative. Customer service agents do not have a respectful or professional approach to people. They just inform you that it's none of their business if you run into problems, that you should have read their ""terms and policies"" before you even consider booking a flight with them, and, in conclusion, that it's just your responsibility to find a solution. They assertively say, in a repetitive manner, that your problem is none of their business!

You need to contact them on phone an they will pass you from one operator to another and even finish the call during this. If you get the chance to talk to somebody entitled to give you any info they just tell that it has been canceled and try to sell you an overpriced ticket (ex. 700 euros for a 100 euros flight).

LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""The nightmare isn't worth it""",19th October 2023,True,"LOT Polish Airlines shouldn't be in business because they are incapable of doing their job. I regret booking our vacation up using this sorry joke of an airline. This was supposed to be multiple destination trip. LA to NYC with 4 nights stay and NYC to Moldova for 4 days as well to visit family. October 9th through 19th. We booked weeks in advance. A week before the trip we received an email saying that our return flight has been canceled and we fly back on the 22nd. No options offered or apologies. As if this is acceptable. People chose certain dates because they have to go back to work! We tried calling them and Expedia. Expedia couldn't do anything so we had to deal with LOT. They didn't accommodate us to return on the day we were supposed to. Not even the day before. It was the 17th of October they offered instead of 19th and we have to spend a night in Warsaw. Before we had a good connection. So we lost 2 days of the trip already.. Now to make it worse when we arrived to JFK on the 13th for our flight to Moldova our plane was broken and they failed to fix it for nearly 5 hours. Needless to say we missed our connection and had to stay in Warsaw yet again! That's another day taken out of my time with family. Absolutely unacceptable. We were supposed to have 4 days in Chisinau and ended up with 1 and a half. They do give you vouchers for hotels, meals and taxi. But that hotel is a whole review on its own and not a good one.

Everything went seamless and I honestly enjoyed the experience. The LOT staff on arrival, in the Warsaw airport, were very friendly and helped me with the transfer directions so I managed to reach my gate very quickly. Then the staff which onboarded us were also of big help since I wasn't sure my luggage would fit in the plane so they proposed to handle my baggage without any additional costs. It was probably my best experience with a budget/low-cost airline so far. The previous flight from KIV to WAW > HAM was also fine and it was my first life experience with transfer flights. It's nearly impossible to get lost in that airport, especially with so many crew members around, you can always find someone to ask for help. (even the stewardess dropping some sparkling water on me during the flight to HAM wasn't an issue). The only negative would be maybe the luggage space in the aircraft and the relative small space for your feet between seats (I'm 190 cm high).

LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""do my best to never book LOT again!",24th May 2023,True,"I was traveling with my wife and 1.5-year-old baby. They delayed our flight by 30-minute increments, and never gave us a reason why. The original departure was supposed to be 4:30PM. At 9 PM, after 10 delays and 5 hours of waiting at the gate, they told us the plane would only leave the next day at noon / 12PM. We didn't stand in line for the complimentary hotel because we could stay at our friends close to the airport, but the people told us next day that it took 3+ hours, or until midnight. The following day at 9AM when we checked in they gave us food vouchers but none of the restaurants accepted it. We never asked for food vouchers so this seemed like such a strange thing to make us even more irritated.  The plane was set to leave at noon / 12PM but they kept delaying the flight again by 30-minute increments and we were close to rebooking to another flight (where the customer service rep said that they probably won't reimburse us for), but then they finally announced at 4PM that we're ready to board. After sitting for an extra 2 hours on the plane, we finally departed at 6PM. We arrived at our destination 24 hours late. A minor irritant: We asked to have our carry-on baggage checked in because we were with a baby and it's easier to traverse the airport without having to tow that around. The first day they said they won't because the plane isn't full. At the check-in gate an hour later I asked if the plane isn't full could they perhaps secure a whole row (3 seats) for my family so the baby could possibly sleep between us. There they said the plane is full. The following day when we checked in again we asked if they could check in our carry-ons as well and they did so, no questions asked. So the first day someone was either lying or just not willing to even try to help out. I called customer service when we got in to see if we could have our return flight changed to a week later and they said that they can only change it to a day later per policy, because that's how much the plane was delayed. But, the day later date had a 16-hour layover vs our original 2-hour layover so they offered to shorten our trip by a day if we'd like. And to make matters even more mind-boggling I checked online and the 1-day later flight was actually more expensive then the 1-week later flight. They'd give me a more expensive return flight because their policy doesn't let them give me a flight that's further out than the delay we experienced.  Other irritant: None of the tv remotes worked on the transatlantic flight, so I couldn't even turn on the light or do anything with it really. Final irritant: The seat I sat in reclined but didn't stay there. So every time I leaned forward to get my book or grab a drink, it came with me, and then I had to recline it again, irritating the person sitting behind me. All of this with a baby in tow. He was surprisingly patient though, more patient than a lot of the other travelers, also slept through the whole flight in the end! So anyway, worst trip ever on LOT's part. And then customer service couldn't even give me a different return flight (apart from one with a 16 hour layover instead of our original 2 hour) after a 24 hour delay. All this for $2,700 USD.

Once on the flight we noticed no spot for a bassinet. We asked and we were told our seats were changed. Horrible experience with LOT. Not all they say they are. Not worth the money needed to fly and use a bassinet. Their reviews are grossly incorrect.,Dreamliner,Family Leisure,Business Class,Warsaw to Toronto,April 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
LOT Polish Airlines,2,"""Very disorderly boarding""",21st May 2023,True,"Very disorderly boarding at Warsaw, and instead of ensuring a timely and smooth boarding process, unfriendly ground staff started measuring and weighing hand luggage just at boarding time. Pieces above 8 kg were forcibly checked into the hold, allegedly to save space in the cabin, and were not delivered at the aircraft but via baggage reclaim. I certainly won't pay (solidly) and fly an airline again whose ground staff bully their customers. Cabin crew were fine on both legs, friendly and attentive.",,Business,Business Class,Warsaw to Hamburg,May 2023,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no
LOT Polish Airlines,2,"""It was a torture""",28th April 2023,True,"The economy seats on such a long flight (more than 8hrs) are very narrow. I was seating at the emergency row, but this didn't help to achieve some level of comfort. I am only 58kg women with super lean body shape and practically didn't have any space to move. When meals were served I could use my utensils and stand up to eat. Men next to me spilled his drink, as he hit my elbow. I never flew a plane with such narrow seats. Some people were standing most of the flight. It was a torture and it is completely unacceptable.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Warsaw,March 2023,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,1,no
LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""appalling customer service""",31st March 2023,True,"I'd flown with LOT before so I already knew they were bargain basement, but sometimes given the combinations of schedule and cost, they are unavoidable. This was especially the case when flying in 2021 from New York to Europe for the Euros that had been delayed due to the pandemic. We had booked our flights and were all set when a week before our trip and completely by accident we noticed that unlike most other European cities, Poland wasn't even allowing transit passengers within their country. LOT's response of course was to blame it on us, as opposed to the fact they are Poland's national airline and at the time this information was very hard to get. We had to scramble and book an alternative flight, and after much chasing down they begrudgingly gave us each a voucher to use valid for one year. Of course, traveling from New York to Europe via the routes they fly isn't easy, so a few weeks ago we decided to give the vouchers to our friends who could use them before expiration. Upon trying to book the flight we were suddenly told that the vouchers were non transferable and non-combinable. The vouchers say nothing of the kind about any of these restrictions, and neither does their website. In fact, their website specifically says vouchers are transferable, but when pointing that out we were told these were a different class of voucher which just so happens not to be documented anywhere. We contacted LOT by every channel, and every channel just regurgitated the same response without being able to explain why none of these restrictions are documented in our voucher. Simply appalling customer service.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to New York via Warsaw,May 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

First flight was boarded by the bus which wasn't problem as weather was good and it went smooth enough, the next in the jetbridge. Overall recommend as they were comfortable and smooth flights.",Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kraków to Budapest via Warsaw,March 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,5,yes

LOT Polish Airlines,1,"""do not follow their own policies""",25th March 2023,True,"On March 13 2023 I bought the tickets and within 3 hours after purchase I filled the refund form on their official website. After 8 days (21st of March) I received an email confirmation of my refund request which would be processed within 14 days. As per their official website, they have a policy called Procedure 24H, which allows clients to get full refund for tickets if request is filed within 24 hours after purchase and the ticket number begins with 080. My ticket matched both of these criteria as I filed request form within 3 hours after purchase. But on 21st of March I received a refund of 68$ which is not even half of what I paid for tickets (419$). Their support team takes ages to reply, both on Facebook messenger and Whatsapp. They do not follow their own policies, just trying to rip off.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baku to Vienna via Warsaw,March 2023,,,,,,,1,no

Their seats were torn. Stewards were rude and the food was very standard! I was drinking Irish cream liquor and after two drinks when I asked for the third one they said they don’t have it anymore. While I was just having my desserts they switched of the cabin lights for everyone and the passenger next to me too couldn’t even finish her dinner.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Zagreb to Chicago,February 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
